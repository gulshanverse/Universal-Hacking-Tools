# Web Cache Poisoning

> Defensive knowledge page for a cache stores a response influenced by input that should not affect shared content.

## Description

A cache stores a response influenced by input that should not affect shared content. Assess the concrete implementation and trust boundary; the class name alone does not prove exploitability.

## Severity and Context

High is a context-dependent starting point. Evaluate exposure, preconditions, affected data, exploitability, and business impact using a documented method.

## Root Cause

The root cause is a mismatch between untrusted input or state and the control that should constrain it. Confirm the actual data flow and authorization model.

## Affected Technology

Potentially affected technologies include Http, Nginx, Apache. Verify the implementation and version before assigning a finding.

## Preconditions

Document the required access, configuration, role, data state, and environmental assumptions. Validate only in a local intentionally vulnerable lab or an explicitly authorized assessment.

## Impact

Potential impact can involve confidentiality, integrity, availability, privacy, compliance, or operational harm. Minimize validation to what is necessary to establish risk.

## Safe Attack Concept

Use a local fixture, synthetic data, or an intentionally vulnerable training application to demonstrate the security boundary. Do not provide payloads or workflows for unrelated systems.

## Detection

Review relevant application, API, identity, network, cloud, endpoint, and configuration telemetry. Add regression tests that prove the intended control and monitor for recurrence.

## Mitigation

Apply Secure Configuration, Security Headers as appropriate. Fix the root cause, use secure defaults, minimize privileges, and verify the fix with a repeatable test.

## Secure Coding Practices

Use threat modeling, context-appropriate validation, safe libraries, explicit authorization, code review, dependency review, and regression tests. Avoid security theater and unsupported claims.

## Safe Lab

Use a disposable local application, synthetic artifact, or approved CTF. Snapshot before testing, protect collected data, and reset the environment afterward.

## Related CWE

[CWE-349](https://cwe.mitre.org/) — verify the precise mapping for the implementation under review.

## Related OWASP Category

Use the current [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) or relevant OWASP project taxonomy; classifications evolve.

## Related MITRE ATT&CK Technique

Only add an ATT&CK mapping when observed behavior supports it. Consult [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) rather than guessing an ID.
